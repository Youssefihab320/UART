# UART
This project implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) using MUXs, DeMUXs, Counters, and Registers. Unlike traditional designs that use a register to load data manually at the transmitter (Tx), this design utilizes an 8-bit counter to automatically generate and send data, simplifying the process and reducing manual input.
